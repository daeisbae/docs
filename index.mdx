## Mission

This journal documents the journey and technical depth required to become a Cloud Security Engineer. It focuses on **why** security controls exist, not just how to configure them.

Expect detailed breakdowns of:
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**: The perimeter of the cloud.
- **Network Security**: VPCs, Flow Logs, and zero-trust patterns.
- **Threat Detection**: GuardDuty, Security Hub, and custom findings.
- **Incident Response**: Automation and forensics.

## Philosophy

> "Security is not a blocker; it is a quality requirement."

This documentation prioritizes:
1.  **Least Privilege**: Always starting with zero access.
2.  **Immutability**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) over manual clicks.
3.  **Visibility**: You cannot protect what you cannot see.
