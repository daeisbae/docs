## Mission

This journal documents the journey and technical depth required to become a Cloud Security Engineer. It focuses on **why** security controls exist, not just how to configure them.

Expect detailed breakdowns of:
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**: The perimeter of the cloud.
- **Network Security**: VPCs, Flow Logs, and zero-trust patterns.
- **Threat Detection**: GuardDuty, Security Hub, and custom findings.
- **Incident Response**: Automation and forensics.
